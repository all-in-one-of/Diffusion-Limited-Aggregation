The primary objective of this work is to explore the phenomenon of Diffusion Limited Aggregation inside 3D models using Houdini. A brief discussion on DLA and the approach used for the implementation of same in Houdini will be examined. Issues intrinsic to the process will
be addressed along with the solutions employed. As a final wrap up, few of the many possible application of the designed system will be touched upon.

#Key controls for implementing behaviors:

‘s’ or ‘S’ = separation

‘a’ or ‘A’ = alignment

‘c’ or ‘C’ = cohesion

‘f’ or ‘F’ = flocking

‘p’ or ‘P’ = path following

‘l’ or ‘L’ = flow field following ranaom

'm' or 'M' = flow field following cos sin wave

‘q’ = clear screen // can be used to clear screen after each behavior to provide fresh space for the new one.
